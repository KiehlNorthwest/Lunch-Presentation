Sample Repository to clone and update

Problem: Simple componentized programming challenges that we’ve faced in the past that we addressed and move forward in projects:
Examples
Capture uploaded file and store in database
Business rules that need to be applied to data being saved
Async job workflow pipeline
Logging

Sources:
Mostly just google how to do x, then find the first solution that seems reasonable. Depending on the technology using google search filters to only get somewhat recent solutions
Stackoverflow
Github
Software engineering stackexchange
Codeplex - bad
 
We have a company Github, it would be good to use it to capture architectural patterns to move between companies. I’ve recently had problems with certificate issues doing source control via github, but overall it is easy to download repos, but not necessarily upload. 

Discussion:
Do you carry code from one project to the next?
What are some code patterns that you reuse between projects?
Would you consider a company repository ‘more trusted’ than other sources?
Would you post code to the company?
Can we post things publically, or would we need private repositories?

Things to store:
Templates (code and document)
Simple architectures
Snippets
