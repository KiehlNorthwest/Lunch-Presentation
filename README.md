# Lunch-Presentation
Sample Repository to clone and update

Problem: Simple componentized programming challenges that we’ve faced in the past that we addressed and move forward in projects:
Examples
Capture uploaded file and store in database
Business rules that need to be applied to data being saved
Async job workflow pipeline
Logging

Sources:
Mostly just google how to do x, then find the first solution that seems reasonable. Depending on the technology using google search filters to only get somewhat recent solutions
Stackoverflow
Github
Software engineering stackexchange
Codeplex - bad
 
We have a company Github, it would be good to use it to capture architectural patterns to move between companies. I’ve recently had problems with certificate issues doing source control via github, but overall it is easy to download repos, but not necessarily upload. 

Discussion:
Do you carry code from one project to the next?
Marty - Web caching, problems and solutions
jake - batch files to run sql scripts, technical specs: templates, requirements
Barbara - EVERYTHING
Ian - Templates 
Look at privacy rules for the state

What are some code patterns that you reuse between projects?
visual studio solutions
javascript libraries and functions
captcha -not crap
docusign and e-signature - module
SAW integration
extension methods
build list - checklist for project setup, naming conventions, todo list
onboarding tool list
coding practices, naming conventions, best practices

Would you consider a company repository ‘more trusted’ than other sources?
 Person who developed it is available - company history
 See the history
Would you post code to the company?
Can we post things publically, or would we need private repositories?

Jake wants;
If you post something - use training time to put things up on Github

Things to store:
Templates (code and document)
